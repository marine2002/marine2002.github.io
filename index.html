                    <p>
                        It's great to MLEM, I really love it, especially if it's a cat. Dogs are serious competitors, but who knows better MLEM than a cute little black cat? Nobody ! A sticky tongue on your muzzle is a lot of fun isn't it? I love it, it entertains me! Do you know what entertains me too? The wheel of fortune, too bad it does not appear on TV anymore, I'm a little disappointed, but that's life.

                    <p>
                        You might be wondering why this site has been talking about MLEM from the start? Let me tell you just one thing: mind your own business. That's it, you are a web developer, you do Jquery and you know how to do 3px padding! Congratulations, I'm proud of you, but mind your own business.

                        And then shit, this is my site, I put what I want in it. I have a fireman brother, and I prefer dark chocolate. And yeah man not too disappointed? Yes ? So much the better. No I'm not hateful, don't look at me like that !! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
                        There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
                        He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready

                        What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
                        He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
                        He's chokin ', how, everybody's jokin' now
